## About

GardenBuddy is a water-tracker app for container gardeners. You can create and keep track of multiple plants, storing the planting date, name, how often you want to water it, and whether the plant is indoors or outdoors for each plant. 

In settings, you can choose the location of your garden, and GardenBuddy will monitor the weather at your garden for you. If your garden gets more than 1.5 centimeters of rain, GardenBuddy will automatically mark all outdoor plants as having been watered that day. You can also choose what time of day you would like GardenBuddy to send you notification reminders to water your plants.
